To do
=====

Move cleaned repo back to Xcode


1. Testing with starting positive, and updates

2. Correlation of sporeProb and betaSpore - better proposal distn

3. Fix directNe

4. Review problems with under-estimate of introNe

5.
- switch parm to be struct
- switch infSrcType to be enum, and move out of struct.h
6.
- convert infection time proposal distribution to normal, to increase tail size



Unresolved issues
- recovery periods that are long tend to be under-estimated, end up using prior to constrain
- correlation of sporeProb and betaSpore
