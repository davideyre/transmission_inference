To do
=====


Testing
-------

1. Suite of test scenarios to repeat including all possibilities - initially try 1 of each


Code
----
1. Allow for handling of multiple hospitals
2. Allow for import of data with unknown infection times, sources and source types
3. For now all input times are assumed to be numbered from 1, allow for conversion from date format
4. assume for now genetic distances provided for all samples - not explicitly checked - could add


Improvements
------------
1. Refine genetic likelihood


Application
-----------
1. Apply to WGS1400 dataset


Possibles
---------
1. Allow for false negative tests, i.e. augmentation of sampled, but negative cases
2. Display ESS with each block of chain outputted to screen
